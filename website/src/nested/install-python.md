# Install Python
ComfyUI requires Python for its features. Don't worry, this will not affect anything on the Unity side! 

We'll be using Python 3.10.10 for Windows. Please make sure your Windows machine is higher than Windows 7, or it won't work!

1. Install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

1. To search for Python 3.10.10 with ease, hold `CTRL` + `H` and search for "3.10.10" in the search bar
